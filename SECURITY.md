# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public issue.

- Preferred: open a private advisory via GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting —
  <https://github.com/j4qfrost/sidequest/security/advisories/new>
- Fallback: email `j4qfrost@gmail.com`.

Expect an acknowledgement within ~5 business days (best-effort, solo maintainer). Coordinated
disclosure on a mutually agreed timeline is preferred.

## Supported Versions

This project is pre-1.0. Security fixes land on the default branch; only the latest default-branch
state / current `v0.x` is supported. There are no backports to older tags.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest default branch | ✅ |
| older tags | ❌ |

## Scope

**In scope** (please report):
- Remote or local code execution beyond what the user explicitly asked the tool to do (injection
  through untrusted input, path traversal in output / `--out` arguments, unsafe deserialization).
- Leakage of secrets, credentials, API keys, tokens, or private user content to unintended
  destinations.
- Authentication / authorization bypass or privilege escalation in any networked surface.
- Exposure of on-device user data (contacts, messages, receipts, location, auth tokens) to other
  apps, the network, or logs.
- Over-broad runtime permissions, or insecure handling of the `.env` / identity material the app
  loads at startup.

**Out of scope:**
- Bugs in third-party / downstream tools and dependencies (report those upstream; we'll bump the
  dependency once a fix exists).
- Correctness bugs that produce wrong output but cross no trust boundary — file a normal issue.
- Self-inflicted misconfiguration on the operator's own host.

## Handling of secrets

- **Never embed a credential** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `sk-ant-…`, Forgejo / Woodpecker / GitHub
  tokens, etc.) in code, config, fixtures, or test data. Secrets live in a gitignored `.env` or
  in Vaultwarden; Claude access routes through the `claude` CLI (Max OAuth), never a committed
  API key.
- Credentials are read from the environment at use-time and are not written to disk by this
  project. If you find a code path that violates this, treat it as an in-scope vulnerability.
- Before publishing, sanity-check for leaked material:

  ```bash
  git grep -n -I -E "(sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}|xox[baprs]-|AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{20,}|Bearer [A-Za-z0-9._~+/-]{20,})"
  ```
